# Eye-Exercise

Title: Eye Exercise

Description: This project shows two eyes that follow the curser wherever it moves on the page. The eye balls are the only part that move. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download and then drag and drop the HTML file on the browser.

Future improvements: I would like to figure out how to allow the user to decide what color to make the eyes.
