# Eye-Exercise

Title: Eye Exercise

Description: This project shows two eyes that follow the curser wherever it moves on the page. The eye balls are the only part that move.

How to run: Download and then drag and drop the HTML file on the browser.

Future improvements: I would like to figure out how to make the PacMen go up and down as well.
